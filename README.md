# Grapejuice-DB

This repository contains a database of Roblox games that have been tested under Grapejuice's modified WINE-TKG 7.20. Any games with a rating below Platinum have their respective issues mentioned, if any.

For an understanding of ratings:

- **Platinum**: The game runs (almost?) flawlessly.
- **Gold**: The game runs well with minor issues.
- **Silver**: The game runs well, but may experience some moderate to major issues.
- **Bronze**: The game runs, but not particularly well. Major issues are present and need to be addressed.
- **Garbage**: The game either refuses to run or its anti-cheat detects WINE as a false positive.
